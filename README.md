# TFG-code

In this repository, you will find two files: "TFG_Python" and "TFG_R". The first one contains all the programming done with Python during the completion of the 
Final Degree Project (TFG), including calculations, data filtering, and all the diagrams. The second file includes all the programming done in R, mainly the 
calculation of errors for some of the diagrams using Monte Carlo methods.
